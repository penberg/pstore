What is it?
===========

P-Store is a simple read-optimized database system. The command line tool 
"pstore" implements two commands: "import" and "cat". The former can be used to
convert a CSV file into a P-Store database and the latter can be used to
examine contents of the database.

The design of this system is loosely based on C-Store [1] which is another Open
Source read-optimized database. The main idea is to store tabular data in
column-order to improve read performance for special purpose workloads.

P-Store is in very early stages so don't expect a whole lot from it.

Running the Cucumber tests
==========================

You can use the following command to install Cucumber on your machine:

  $ sudo gem install cucumber rspec fastercsv

Please note that the rubygem version in Mac OS X 10.5, for example, is too old
to install Cucumber successfully, so you need to upgrade it first. Also, Ruby
version 1.8.7 must be used as at least 'fastercsv' shall no longer be used in
1.9.x versions.

On Mac OS X, it is recommended to use Ruby Version Manager (rvm) instead of
installing Ruby with ports or brew:

How can I try it out?
=====================

The first step is to create a database file. You can import a CSV file into a
P-Store database with the following command:

  $ pstore import dataset.csv dataset.out

After that, you can use the "pstore cat" command to look into the imported
database:

  $ pstore cat dataset.out

Java Native Interface
=====================

P-Store provides an API for the Java programming language. To build the JNI API
of the P-Store you will need to set JAVA_HOME enviroment variable.
For example on Mac OS X:

  export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home`
